# Longest non-decreasing sequence of number problem

For example, if you have a sequence of number [10, 12, 8, 9, 20, 31, 28]. The longest non-decreasing sequence would be [10, 12, 20, 31]. Or it can be said like this.

Given a sequence of N numbers – A[1] , A[2] , …, A[N] . Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence.
